# Dynamic User Interface Interactions

There are two UI interactions developed in the current repository:

## Drop-down menu
Create a responsive top navigation bar, that turns into a dropdown menu when the width is small enough.

When transitioning between the hidden or visible nav buttons, I want there to be a transition effect. Transitions
don't work when display is set to none, so I had to play around with opacity/visibility/height. 

[This is a good article that gives a lot of context on how you can combine JS and CSS for transitions](https://www.brucebrotherton.com/blog/transitions-and-event-listeners/)


## Image Carousel
